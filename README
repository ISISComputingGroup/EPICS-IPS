How to run the test simulation, the test ioc and the tests all in one go.

./etc/test/OxInstIPS_test.py -t simulation -i -e -g

Do this from the module top directory after you have built it and also
built the generated ioc directory.  

12/01/2018: Above is not working.  Dont think development of the
simulation was completed and there is no example IOC and no
documentation.

The fact that it is a modular power supply means that several units
can be linked together, but they function as one to deliver power and
also from a Controls point of view.

For example on the DLS BL10J Magnet, 2 units have been coupled together to
make a single power supply unit.

Oxford Instruments reflect this in the model number of what they
supply, so what appear to different models may in fact be similar
units chained together differently.
